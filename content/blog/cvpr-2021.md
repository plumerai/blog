Tim de Bruin, a Deep Learning Scientist at Plumerai, was one of the invited speakers at last week’s CVPR 2021 Workshop on Binarized Neural Networks for Computer Vision. Tim presented some of Plumerai’s work on solving the remaining challenges with BNNs and explains why optimizing for accuracy is not enough.
