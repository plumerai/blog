At this year’s tinyML Summit, we presented our new solution for person detection with bounding boxes. We have developed a person detection model that runs in real time (895 ms latency) on an STM32H7B3 board (Arm Cortex-M7), a popular off-the-shelf available microcontroller. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time anyone runs person detection in real-time on Arm Cortex-M based microcontrollers, and we are very excited to be bringing this new capability to customers!

Watch the video below to see the live demo and learn how Binarized Neural Networks are an integral part of our solution.
