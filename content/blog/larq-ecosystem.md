In our [previous blog post](https://blog.larq.dev/2020/02/announcing-larq-compute-engine/), we announced [Larq Compute Engine](https://docs.larq.dev/compute-engine/) (LCE), our deployment solution for Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs).
The combination of LCE, our training library [Larq](https://docs.larq.dev/) and the models in [Larq Zoo](https://docs.larq.dev/zoo/) forms the first end-to-end solution for anyone building applications using BNNs.
In this post, we take a step back and look at this integrated ecosystem as a whole.
